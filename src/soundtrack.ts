// the same rule as the iOS app: docked → space station; black hole star → black hole; otherwise by
// distance from the core (inner < 300, central < 600, else outer rim). The title theme plays until
// the player's system is known. Advances on the track's known duration (the explorer does not report
// stream end for static files).
